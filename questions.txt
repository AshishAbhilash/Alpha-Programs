Typical C Program Development Environment:

Phase 1: Editing       - Programmer creates a program by entering codes. The editor stores it on the hard disk.
Phase 2: Preprocessing - The preprocessor's program runs automatically before the compiler's translation phase begins.
                         The preprocessor processes the code entered by the programmer.
Phase 3: Compiling     - Compiler creates the object code (or machine language code) and stores it on the disk.
Phase 4: Linking       - The object code usually contains many 'holes'. The linker connects the object code to the
                         libraries for the missing functions to create an executable file.
Phase 5: Loading       - The loader takes the executable image from disk and transfers it to the memory so that the 
                         program can be executed.
Phase 6: Execution     - Finally, the computer, under control of CPU executes the program, one instruction at a time.
